# Cover Type Detection

This lab provides and example implimentation of a multi-class classification problem using Amazon SageMaker.  This example was presented at the DC Summit in Washington DC on September 28 2021

The lab notebook will download the dataset, prepare the data using a SageMaker Processing Job; train a gradient boosed trees algorithm using the SageMaker 'built-in' XGBoost algorithm; and deploy the trained model to a real time SageMaker endpoint.
